# python-challenge
This is Kokila's Python Repository created for PyBank and PyPoll projects.

## Following are the concepts I am using in this Homewrok Projects.
* Reading Data from CSV files
* Using Lists and Dictionaries
* Creating a Summary Report 
* Writing into a Text file

### PyBank:
In this challenge, i was tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company. I was given a set of financial data called **budget_data.csv**. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".
#### Summary Report :
* The total number of months included in the dataset
* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


### PyPoll:
In this challenge, I was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process. I was given a set of poll data called **election_data.csv**. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate".
#### Summary Report :
* The total number of votes cast
* A complete list of candidates who received votes
* The percentage of votes each candidate won
* The total number of votes each candidate won
* The winner of the election based on popular vote.
